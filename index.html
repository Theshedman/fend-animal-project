			<p>The Shih Tzu, also known as the 'Chinese Lion Dog', 'Chrysanthemum Dog' (because its face resembles a flower), or 'shih Tzu Kou' (whchich translates to 'Lion Dog', designating its revered status in Buddhism) originates in Tibet as far back as the 1600's. The Shih Tzu in its current form was primarily developed in China during the reign of Chinese Empress Dowager Cixi in the late 1800's, likely from crosses of the Pekingese with the Lhasea Apso. The Shih Tzu was a favored pet of royalty, but fell into decline when British troops raided the Forbidden City in 1860. The breed survived, but was generally not distinguished from the Lhasa Apso until 1934, when the smaller, shorter noseed variety was reassigned its original Chinese name, 'Shih Tzu'. The Shih Tzu was recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1969 and has continued to climb in popularity to this day. Crossbreeds between Shih Tzu and other toy breeds are also increasing in popularity, particularly crosses with the Poodle and Bichon Frise.</p>
